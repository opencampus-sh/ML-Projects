Single Neuron Signal Analysis

## description:
This project aims at automatically classifying signals recorded from neurons in the human brain. We implemented and tested two neural networks within this project. Multiple signals (spikes) form a cluster and are given one of the following labels: 
1. Single-unit (SU)
2. Multi-unit (MU)
3. Artefact (A)

Data from manually labeled clusters is used as input for training and testing a neural network.
