# INSTRUCTIONS TO UPLOAD YOUR PROJECT

We use this to guarantee the same structure for all projects.
Projects will be then uploaded to our [project page](https://opencampus-sh.github.io/oc-ml-projects/) and there these information will be displayed.
So you can check at any time the [project page](https://opencampus-sh.github.io/oc-ml-projects/) to have an idea about how that would look like.

0. *if you are reading on Github*, clone or download this repository to your computer.
1. rename the folder `project_template_folder` to the name of your project (please avoid spaces in the name of the folder).
2. complete the `INFO.md` file with title, description, students name, course, semester and whatever is asked there
3. upload the required documents:
   * the code (one or more notebooks or python code) in the `code` folder. Inside the folder there is already a notebook with some informations. Please make sure to check it and start from there.
   * a picture of that represent your project in the `preview` folder. It will be used as a preview for the online visualization. It should have width larger than its height (something like 500x280 may work good), but it's not absolutely necessary. It will be centered anyway. Higher resolution will be down-scaled, so do not upload images higher than 720 pixels.
   * other resources you may need in the `resources` folder
   * please do not upload the dataset you used unless there are special reasons.
4. (Optional) rename `INFO.md` as `README.md`. This way when people open your repository page, they will see the information about your project (and not the instructions to upload it). The `README.md` file is automatically showed from github.
5. compress the whole folder as a `.zip` file and check the size. Please do not upload files larger than `10Mb`. If you have special reason to do so, please let us know before you upload.
6. upload the `.zip` file in your course's online page. If you do not know where, ask your teacher.
