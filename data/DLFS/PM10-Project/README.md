# PM10_Prediction

## description:
A ML project to predict PM10 pollution at selected air monitoring stations. 
The machine should be trained with weather data and PM10 pollution data from 
the past. Using weather forecast data, the machine should predict PM10 pollution. 
The machine could be trained with additional data, such as traffic density. 

What is particulate matter or PM10 (German: Feinstaub)?
PM10 are small airborne particles with a diameter of 10 micrometer or less. 
As they are so small, they are especially adverse for health since they penetrate 
deep into our lungs.
