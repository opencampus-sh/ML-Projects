## title: `A Hybrid Approach of Time Series Prediction and Natural Language Processing to Predict Cryptocurrency Value`
 
## description: `The goal of this project is to train a model which is able to classify if the value of specific cryptocurrency would rise or decline in the next day and would it be rational to buy or sell that crypto. 
We are looking for a hybrid approach of LSTM and NLP to predict the value. First through a sentiment analysis, we evaluate how negative and positive contents have impacted the price on a specific day and then we extract a "sentiment score" from the model. We add this new feature to our dataset which already contains following features: 
-Opening and closing price
-Volume
-Adj Price 
Finally through a LSTM model, we train our data to predict if the price would go up or down in the next 24 hours'
