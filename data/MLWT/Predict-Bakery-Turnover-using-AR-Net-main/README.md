# Predict Turnover using AR-Net
An Application of AR-Net on Turnover Time-series Dataset

# Background
AR-Net is a simple auto-regressive Neural Network for time-series ([link to paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.12436)).

# Install
1. Go to the developers' repository ([link to repository](https://github.com/ourownstory/AR-Net/blob/master/README.md#ar-net))
2. After downloading the code repository (via git clone), change to the repository directory (cd AR-Net) and install arnet as python package with pip install .

# Application
View the notebook [arnet_bakery_turnover.ipynb](https://github.com/Modeuss/Predict-Bakery-Turnover-using-AR-Net/blob/main/Predicting_Bakery_Turnover_AR-Net_Modelling-HyperparameterSearch.ipynb) for an application of the AR-Net model to Predict Bakery Turnover including Hyperparameters search and results.
