# Deep Learning Projecsts - Winter Semester 20/21

## Face Mask Recognition (WiSe 20/21)
##### Adnan Nooruddin, Ravish Kumar, Christoph Eberz, Bennet MÃ¶ller
More important than ever in this pandemic times, how can we quickly prove that everybody is wearing a mask?
This project has an answer, with a detection system which tells from a picture whether the person is wearing a mask or not.

## Painting Classification (WiSe 20/21)
##### John Jay Kimani, Nils Berns
Which  painted this painting? Nils and John tried to answer this question using neural networks with different approaches, discover more in their presentation.

## Bike Sharing Prediction (SprottenFlotte) (WiSe 20/21)
#### Andrej Ponomarenko, Daniel Michells
Where will the next bike be borrowed? Analyzing the SprottenFlotte data from Kiel using different neural network a prediction can be made to decide where more bikes will be needed.
*Note: the data for this project is private and cannot be shared, only the results.*

## Windfinder Predictions (WiSe 20/21)
##### Lennart Petersen
Predicting the best spot for surfing is a hard task, yet Lennart gave it a great shot and developed a model to predict it with 86% of accuracy.
*Note: the data for this project is private and cannot be shared, only the results.*

## Image Segmentation (WiSe 20/21) - [Own Repo](https://github.com/yej117/Image_Segmentation_Deep_Learning)
##### Yi-Jie Yang, Sebastian Koch, Erwin Smith and Suman Singha
In many application today, we need to segment images to separate an object from the background.
This is quite a complicated task, but it's worth a shot! Using a U-Net the group was able to do some interesting work on a Kaggle Challenge.

## COVID-19 Detection on X-Ray Image (WiSe 20/21) - [Own Repo](https://github.com/Mithunjack/COVID-19-Xray-Image-Classification)
##### Mithun Das, Mohammad Wasif Islam, Rakibuzzaman Mahmud, Sarker Miraz Mahfuz
Can we detect COVID from an X-Ray image of the lungs?
It turns out we can, or better, a software can do that for us.
This project achieved an accuracy of 0.9896 on this task!

## Disease Classification on Medical XRay Images (WiSe 20/21) - [Own Repo](https://github.com/Mnpr/Thoractic-Diseases-Detection)
##### Sudesh Acharya
Can a neural network distinguish different types of diseases just by looking at a single X-Ray image of the lungs?
Quite an ambitious task, yet the project shows promising results in this direction.
